# vois_project-
it is team based project
This is a basic music recommendation project that i made for the vois internship where i learned the machine learning for the first time and i prepared the on my very basic knowledge 
I used the knn algorithm, I used the dataset which is available from the kaggle 
vois paltfrom helps me in making a perfect project starting from the abstract to end where we getting the required output 
in the process we learn about the autoviz (a libaray) and we made the auto Visualization report by using it
and we also attached the accuracy report checking with the other algorithms
I also attached the EDA report for this project repo
